# BookTime
* BookTime will provide users with easy access to their favorite novels, biographies, short stories, and more!  Users will be able to search for a specific book based on title, author, or a key word. Each book entry will contain:
	*A plot summary
	*An MLA citation
	*Links to purchase the book
		*Information on availability and price
	*A sample of 100-200 words from the book, which the user can read (specifying his or her 	start/stop with the corresponding buttons).  The website will generate an estimate accordingly 	of how long it will take the user to read the book, depending on his or her rate of words read 	per minute.
